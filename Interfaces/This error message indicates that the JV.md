This error message indicates that the JVM is unable to locate the main class named "App" under the package "Interfaces". To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if your file structure matches the package hierarchy. For example, if your main class is in the package "com.example.app", then you should have a corresponding directory structure where the main class file is located in "/path/to/project/src/com/example/app".

2. Make sure that the main class is declared with the correct package name in the source file. For example, if your main class is in the package "com.example.app", then the source code should begin with "package com.example.app;".

3. Verify that the classpath is set up correctly. You can check the classpath by running the command "java -version" in your terminal or command prompt. If the path to your main class is not included in the classpath, you can add it using the "-cp" option followed by the path to your class file.

Here's an example command to run a Java class in package "Interfaces":
```
java -cp /path/to/project/src Interfaces.App
```
Make sure to adjust the classpath and package name as necessary for your particular setup.
